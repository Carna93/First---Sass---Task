                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 
                1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more 
                recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of 
                Lorem Ipsum.

                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
                        at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia.

                        Looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a 
                        Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical 
                        literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

                        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
                        (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise 
                        on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
